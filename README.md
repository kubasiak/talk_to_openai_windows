## This is fun repo to try to communicate to OpenAI GPT model by voice

to use:
- make sure you have OpenAI account, credentials, and deployed at least one qna model
- clone this repository
- update .evn
- execute:
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\sripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It should work, but this repo is not something very well tested, just fun project


```
.env
SPEECH_ENDPOINT =
SPEECH_KEY=
SPEECH_REGION=
OPENAI_API_BASE=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_QnA_MODEL =
